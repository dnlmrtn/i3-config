# i3 Window Manager Configuration

This repository contains the configuration file for the i3 window manager.

## About i3

[i3](https://i3wm.org/) is a tiling window manager designed for X11. It is known for its efficiency and minimalism, providing a fast and customizable user experience.

## Configuration File

The `config` file in this repository configures various aspects of i3, including keybindings, startup applications, and workspace management.

### Key Features

- **Mod Key**: `$mod` is set to `Mod4` (typically the Super/Windows key).
- **Autostart**: Uses `dex` to start XDG autostart .desktop files.
- **Screen Lock**: Uses `xss-lock` and `i3lock` for screen locking on suspend.
- **Network Management**: Starts `nm-applet` for managing wireless networks.
- **Volume Control**: Adjusts volume using `pactl` and updates status with `i3status`.
- **Workspace Management**: Defines workspaces and assigns applications to them.
- **Window Management**: Includes keybindings for moving, resizing, and focusing windows.
- **Bar Configuration**: Uses `i3status` for the status bar.

### Keybindings

The configuration includes various keybindings for:

- Launching applications (`$mod+d` for `dmenu_run`).
- Moving between workspaces (`$mod+1` to `$mod+0`).
- Managing windows (resizing, focusing, moving).
- Layout management (stacked, tabbed, fullscreen).

### Additional Notes

- **Customization**: Feel free to modify keybindings or add new ones to suit your workflow.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `dex`, `xss-lock`, `i3lock`, `nm-applet`, and `i3status` are installed for full functionality.
